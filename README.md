# SiamCPN | Develop from Pysot

SiamCPN is developed based on [PySot](https://github.com/STVIR/pysot). Our work has achieved a single target tracking method using a central point. The code base is for reference by relevant researchers only, and may not be used in any commercial activities without permission.

**PySOT** is a software system designed by SenseTime Video Intelligence Research team. It implements state-of-the-art single object tracking algorithms, including [SiamRPN](http://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2018/html/Li_High_Performance_Visual_CVPR_2018_paper.html) and [SiamMask](https://arxiv.org/abs/1812.05050). It is written in Python and powered by the [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org) deep learning framework. This project also contains a Python port of toolkit for evaluating trackers.

PySOT has enabled research projects, including: [SiamRPN](http://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2018/html/Li_High_Performance_Visual_CVPR_2018_paper.html), [DaSiamRPN](https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.06048), [SiamRPN++](https://arxiv.org/abs/1812.11703), and [SiamMask](https://arxiv.org/abs/1812.05050).

## Installation

Please find installation instructions for PyTorch and PySOT in [`INSTALL.md`](INSTALL.md).

## Quick Start: Using PySOT

### Add PySOT to your PYTHONPATH
```bash
export PYTHONPATH=/path/to/pysot:$PYTHONPATH
```

### Download models
Download models in [PySOT Model Zoo](MODEL_ZOO.md) and put the model.pth in the correct directory in experiments

### Webcam demo
```bash
python tools/demo.py \
    --config experiments/siamrpn_r50_l234_dwxcorr/config.yaml \
    --snapshot experiments/siamrpn_r50_l234_dwxcorr/model.pth
    # --video demo/bag.avi # (in case you don't have webcam)
```

### Download testing datasets
Download datasets and put them into `testing_dataset` directory. Jsons of commonly used datasets can be downloaded from [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/10cfXjwQQBQeu48XMf2xc_W1LucpistPI) or [BaiduYun](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1js0Qhykqqur7_lNRtle1tA#list/path=%2F). If you want to test tracker on new dataset, please refer to [pysot-toolkit](https://github.com/StrangerZhang/pysot-toolkit) to setting `testing_dataset`. 

### Test tracker
```bash
cd experiments/siamrpn_r50_l234_dwxcorr
python -u ../../tools/test.py 	\
	--snapshot model.pth 	\ # model path
	--dataset VOT2018 	\ # dataset name
	--config config.yaml	  # config file
```
The testing results will in the current directory(results/dataset/model_name/)

### Eval tracker
assume still in experiments/siamrpn_r50_l234_dwxcorr_8gpu
``` bash
python ../../tools/eval.py 	 \
	--tracker_path ./results \ # result path
	--dataset VOT2018        \ # dataset name
	--num 1 		 \ # number thread to eval
	--tracker_prefix 'model'   # tracker_name
```

###  Training :wrench:
See [TRAIN.md](TRAIN.md) for detailed instruction.
