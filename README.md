# SiamCPN | visual tracking with siamese center-prediction network

SiamCPN is developed based on [PySot](https://github.com/STVIR/pysot). Our work has achieved a single target tracking method using a central point. The code base is for reference by relevant researchers only, and may not be used in any commercial activities without permission.

PySOT has enabled research projects, including: [SiamRPN](http://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2018/html/Li_High_Performance_Visual_CVPR_2018_paper.html), [DaSiamRPN](https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.06048), [SiamRPN++](https://arxiv.org/abs/1812.11703), and [SiamMask](https://arxiv.org/abs/1812.05050).
